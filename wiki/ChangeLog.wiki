ConnectionManager.java Change 1-19-09

Connection Manager was modified to support more than just AIM client API. The change is the use of a hashmap and three methods, GetStrategies (returns strategy from key), AddToMap (adds a new strategy to map), and RemoveStrategy (removes strategy from hashmap).

Build still works after submit.
